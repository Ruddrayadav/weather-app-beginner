# 🌤️ Weather App

A beginner-friendly, responsive Weather App built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, powered by [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/). This app allows users to fetch real-time weather data of any city they enter.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌡️ Displays real-time temperature in Celsius  
- 🌥️ Shows current weather condition with intuitive emoji icons

- DOM manipulation for updating UI  
- Understanding how APIs like WeatherAPI structure data  
- Debugging API results (like avoiding getting Delhi, Canada 😂)
